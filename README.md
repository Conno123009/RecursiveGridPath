# RecursiveGridPath
A robot is sitting on the upper left hand corner of an N x N grid. 
The robot can only move in two directions: right and down to the lower right hand corner. 
There are certain squares which are “off limits” such that the robot cannot step on them, these are random.

Implement a recursive method that outputs all possible paths for the robot for each value of M and N.
